ESLint has been disabled for a bit during the initial stages

During the development, the eslint has been very aggressive and till we have 
the chance to caliber it, we have muted it.

When needed to reset it.

1. rename the .eslintrc.json-disabled to .eslintrc.json
2. remove the note: "please see" part from the json
3. add the following in the dev part of the package.json file
    "eslint": "8.8.0",
    "eslint-config-airbnb": "19.0.4",
    "eslint-config-prettier": "8.3.0",
    "eslint-plugin-import": "2.25.4",
    "eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y": "6.5.1",
    "eslint-plugin-prettier": "4.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "7.28.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "4.3.0",

4. remove the package-lock.json
5. npm install
6. Enjoy the development
